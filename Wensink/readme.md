# RL FlappyBird Project

Welcome to the FlapyBird project developed by Theo Wensink, during the Machine Learning Course at ISAE-SUPAERO.

## Getting Started

During this project, I have developed a Q-Learning algorithm enabling FlappyBird to learn learn to play.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

## Built With

* [PyGame Learning Environment](http://pygame-learning-environment.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/games/flappybird.html) - PyGame Learning Environment (PLE) is a learning environment, mimicking the Arcade Learning Environment interface, allowing a quick start to Reinforcement Learning in Python. 
* [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/) - Python 3.6 version
